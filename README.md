Formalization of the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem
==================================================

This library was developped in order to prove the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem,
and is built on top of a modified version of the MathComp, finmap and
multinomials library.

In particular, LindemannTheorem.v contains the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, as well as
Baker's reformulation of this theorem. It also contains a proof of the
Hermite-Lindemann theorem, and several proofs of the transcendence of e and pi
as applications of each theorems.

The library can be installed via opam (name of the library : coq-lindemann)
